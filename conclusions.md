# Conclusions

Based on our observations of four studios, we believe that design pedagogy represents one productive future of the current postpedagogical moment. We believe so, in part, because design pedagogy speaks to a number of recent and pressing concerns in rhetoric and composition—like public engagement, collaborative practices, and materiality—but also because it promises to re-connect us to valuable but neglected traditions.

In 2003 David Fleming argued that the time for the progymnasmata, the series of rhetorical exercises for students developed by ancient Greek rhetoricians, “has come (again)” (118). The “very idea” of the progymnasmata, if not their specific practices from ancient times, deserves serious re-consideration, Fleming believes, because it is “devoted to the development in students of a particular set of verbal habits and dispositions” (113). In his formulation, the progymnasmata result from “the attempt to make of rhetoric not just a theory or art or an historical and cultural artifact or a sociocognitive process but rather a complete and developmentally attuned curriculum in written and spoken discourse, a multicourse program of language instruction whose end product is neither a text nor a skill nor some body of knowledge but a set of deep-seated verbal habits and dispositions oriented to public effectiveness and virtue” (114). For Fleming, the progymnasmata are still valuable as curricular models for five of their features in particular:

- The way students work on elements of larger tasks rather than tackling the full-scale of a project all at once (115).
- The focus on “pegs” on which to hang “verbal and ideational material” (116).
- The inclusion of a “wide variety of rhetorical elements to work on” (116).
- The thoughtful ordering of activities (116).
- The aim of integration across learning (117).

While instructional methods and curricular and pedagogical design in rhetoric and composition have moved away from the style of the progymnasmata, it may be that something like the original intentions and effects of the progymnasmata live on in the pedagogical methods of design studios. After all, the studios we observed enact every one of these features, albeit in diverse frames-for-work: they ask students to move through scaffolded activities both within the timeframe of single semesters as well as on the scale of entire degree programs; they emphasize embodied, material, and spatial ways of learning and knowing; they embrace diversity in terms of project tasks and possibilities; and, lastly, but perhaps most importantly, they encourage the integration of many forms of knowledge and modes of work. Scaffolding in this style of approach does not mean overt de-contextualization or an assertion of a rigid process so much as focusing first on smaller scale, discrete (but only for the moment) tasks while maintaining mindfulness of larger contexts and goals.

We think there is value in connecting the dots between the historical intentions and methods of the progymnasmata with the questions asked by postpedagogy, and the methods and materials of design studio education. And so, with cautious optimism, we offer some preliminary recommendations and caveats about experimenting with studio methods. While these suggestions are meant to highlight concrete, practical ways of implementing design pedagogy, we also hope that they serve as a starting point for reimagining the role of the progymnasmata in twenty-first century writing and rhetoric curricula.

**Assemble your own frame-for-work by surveying the landscape of affordances and constraints in your class and on your campus, but make sure it facilitates interaction that is in some ways high impact, collaborative, DIY, and materially-engaged.** Developing frames-for-work involve different configurations of what we have identified as the four features of design pedagogy. While it is tempting to say that our classes will benefit if we simply pick and choose from a couple of these features to inform new pedagogical practices, we do not think that is the case. Rather, in order to acheive a rich, well-designed learning environment, all four features must be integrated into the course's design. Here are some possibiltiies to consider when constructing frames-for-work:

- Involve campus partners, community partners, or commercial partners, either by design or through students’ own initiative.
- Craft projects and assignments in ways that give students a chance to interact with each other in a variety of arrangements and modes.
- Allow for and expect that students will have to seek out knowledge in order to complete their project -- that it will not all come from you or the assigned readings or even from research in the library -- and communicate these expectations.
- Make sure that writing is not the only activity in a writing or rhetoric class; students should also be drawing, taking pictures, recording/editing audio and video, arranging and experimenting with materials, building, coding, and so on.

**Talk about process in a new way.** In spite of the coming (and perhaps passing) of the postprocess moment, most of us in the field have never stopped invoking the importance of process in some fashion or another. Rather than thinking of process as a knowable series of tasks, we suggest approaching your course design as a kind of non-linear, flexible scaffolding. This is not to say that predetermined tasks do not exist; rather, in a studio approach teams will inevitably need to rearrange, invent, and reinvent tasks according to their own systems of working.

Many depictions of the design process have begun to appear in higher education contexts, and we think it is useful to consider a few of the examples we have encountered during the course of our research. Pictured below are three interesting models of design pedagogy from recent conferences. The first picture is a powerpoint slide from Peter Kittle's presentation at the 2016 Conference on College Composition and Communication. Kittle attempts to visualize the steps of design by mapping the design process directly onto the conventional steps associated with the writing process. We appreciate this effort to begin to “design-ify” process, which is necessary and important work. Yet, this set of steps still represents a more or less linear, chronological sequence. In other words, renaming the steps in a traditional process model does not transform that model, and therefore it still represents what postprocess theories critique about traditional process. What we find most valuable about Kittle's visualization, however, is his attention to "release" and "community," which the other two models pictured below do not consider. In this sense Kittle offers a model that is more high impact than other representations we have seen.

The next two photos are of Marlo Ransdell's slides from her 2016 presentation at the Association of American Colleges & Universities Conference. One depicts writing processes and the other visualizes the design thinking process. In some ways, these slides make improvements on the process represented in Kittle's presentation. In Ransdell's slides, process is represented as ambiguous, plural, and -- maybe most importantly -- recursive. These images more accurately show that students' individual processes (the “how I  work”) will not emerge until they are well into the process of developing projects in collaboration with team members. Much like Arjun Dhillon's decription of "the Squiggle," in these two slides process is depicted as something that we must attempt to articulate, but which we can never fully know ahead of time.

Engaging with students in process-talk but in a design-savvy, plural way must play a salient role in design pedagogy. Adapting or revising "designified" process models similar to the ones featured above will provide students with some initial structure while also giving them the freedom to figure out ways of working and collaborating throughout the development of their projects.

**Model the dispositions that you hope to cultivate in students.** One possible set of such dispositions are the "8 Studio Habits of Mind," which are published in _Studio Thinking_ (Hetland et al.), promoted in Harvard’s Project Zero ("Project"), and adapted for a range of different disciplines and purposes. For example, we found this version for artists--from Rankine-Landers' "Teaching Channel" blog post--to be especially useful:

8 Studio Habits of Mind

1. Develop Craft: Learning to use tools, materials, artistic conventions; and learning to care for tools, materials, and space.

2. Engage & Persist: Learning to embrace problems of relevance within the art world and/or of personal importance, to develop focus conducive to working and persevering at tasks.

3. Envision: Learning to picture mentally what cannot be directly observed, and imagine possible next steps in making a piece.

4. Express: Learning to create works that convey an idea, a feeling, or a personal meaning.

5. Observe: Learning to attend to visual contexts more closely than ordinary “looking” requires, and thereby to see things that otherwise might not be seen.

6. Reflect: Learning to think and talk with others about an aspect of one’s work or working process, and learning to judge one’s own work and working process and the work of others.

7. Stretch & Explore: Learning to reach beyond one’s capacities, to explore playfully without a preconceived plan, and to embrace the opportunity to learn from mistakes.

8. Understand (Arts) Community: Learning to interact as an artist with other artists (i.e., in classrooms, in local arts organizations, and across the art field) and within the broader society. Arts is in parenthesis here as it can easily be switched with other disciplines, like science or history.


We might turn to sophistic pedagogy to clarify how to cultivate these “Habits of Mind." As Debra Hawhee notes, “sophistic pedagogy emphasized the materiality of learning, the corporeal acquisition of rhetorical movements through rhythm, repetition, and response. This manner of learning-doing entails ‘getting a feel for’ the work’” (160). That is, through repetition and practice, teachers and students can get “a feel for” these habits of mind until they become dispositionally incorporated. However, it is important to point out that these habits of mind will look and feel different for each individual learning situation. This is why response is key. As Hawhee states, “sophistic-style rhetorical training is always bound up with responsiveness within particular contexts” (160).

Even as we invent scaffolded environments in which students can work, thus enabling them to hone their own repetition-and-response habits, we continually re-invent and co-occupy these spaces with students. In this sense, we involve ourselves in the progymnasmata; along with our students we develop “a set of deep-seated verbal habits and dispositions oriented to public effectiveness and virtue” (Fleming 114). Desiging spaces for students to co-design with us, in other words, will help us cultivate these dispositions in ourselves, even as we help to cultivate them in students. Design pedagogy requires a deeply collaborative environment where teachers and students necessarily work together to develop practices that can lead to significant learning experiences.

**Keep ethics at the center of design approaches.** While terms like design, studio, design thinking, hacking, making, craft, and makerspaces are often used interchangeably, they are not the same things. These terms have very different histories, practices, purposes, and ideologies. For example, design thinking, for many academics, evokes an association with the corporate, for-profit world of start-ups. Sometimes that is enough to repel interest, but not always. In his keynote at the 2016 Thomas R. Watson conference, for instance, Scott Wible discussed how he uses design practices to connect his students at the University of Maryland, College Park to local community members and projects (e.g. non-profits) as opposed using design pedagogy to forward more business-minded, profit-making efforts. As Wible notes, "Design thinking pedagogy and practice helps us to understand one way that knowledge can be mobilized to foster co-generation of solutions that fit with a community’s
worldviews and everyday practices" ("Design Thinking"). In harnessing the power of design thinking to create significant, community-based learning experiences for his writing students, Wible echoes our field’s longstanding commitment to “service learning” and engaged public work. Like Wible, we see design thinking as a way to energize existing pedagogical service models and opportunities. Reframing and adapting design pedagogy to reflect one's own values is key to using this approach in ethical ways.

Inclusivity is another important ethical consideration of design pedagogy that often gets overlooked. Makerspaces tend to trumpet their progressive, bottom-up political orientations; they aspire to be free spaces for creativity— community centers for non-hierarchical productivity. As Ann Shivers-McNair notes, however, they are also predominantly white, male spaces ("What We Can Learn"). This statement rang true in our field research observations as well. For instance, in Neil Rothman’s mechanical engineering class at UMBC we encountered a large white male majority. This was especially surprising to us since UMBC has a reputation for having one of the most diverse STEM programs in the nation. According to Daniel de Vise, "Many higher-education leaders say no institution does a better job of seeding black students into the sciences than UMBC" ("Quiet Revolution"). The gendered make-up of the course was also extremely unbalanced (there was only one female student in attendance on the days that we observed). Even at a school that is known for its diverse STEM program, problems with diversity persist. We say this not to criticize UMBC in particular, but to point out a larger trend in design-focused classrooms: based on what we have read and observed, diversity may be getting more attention at the institutional-level but there is a long way to go for design spaces to be truly inclusive.

We want to suggest that one way our field might contribute to improving the inclusivity of design spaces is to bring design approaches to a general education student population. [Author's name] class in the Studio Collaborative, for example, is an introduction to rhetoric course that satisfies a general education requirement. The students in this class, that is, are not yet segregated by historical patterns of major or specialization. Students -- of all backgrounds -- sign up and find themselves immersed in a design experience. We believe that by exposing students to design approaches in general education classes such as First Year Writing in a range of different institutional contexts, our field can contribute to the work of breaking down the historical exclusivity of these modes of work and workspaces.

After doing this research, we were struck by the fact that many instructors of writing and rhetoric already embrace *some* aspects—to *some* degree—of the design pedagogy we have laid out. What we hope our work amplifies, however, is the need for more deliberate, explicit, integrated studio approaches in our field. We see design pedagogy as one useful response to the questions raised by postpedagogy. Design pedagogy pulls together a number of postpedagogical threads that are already valued in our disciplinary scholarship--ecology, affect, materiality, public engagement--and makes use of those threads in the classroom in creative, dynamic ways. In this sense, design pedagogy provides us with the opportunity to productively bring together the theoretical and practical in our curricula and course designs.

We began this essay with Paul Lynch's provocative question: "Is teaching still possible?" As we have attempted to illustrate, design pedagogy moves away from authoratative models of knowledge transfer and reimagines teaching as the practice of designing environments in which significant learning can take place. So, yes. Teaching is still possible if we can learn to think of ourselves as designers--as architects of learning experiences.
